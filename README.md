# Anunastart

Anunastart is based on Gromf, but has some adjustments and improvements for better workflow.

Gromf is a WordPress starter theme based on [Roots](https://github.com/roots/roots) 7.0, using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) & [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) instead of Bootstrap & Grunt.
